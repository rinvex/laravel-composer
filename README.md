## Usage

The main purpose of this package is to adjust Composer's default behavior, allowing custom packages to install outside the `vendor` directory. It uses the Composer Plugin API and has built-in support for Rinvex Cortex modules, extensions, and themes.

### Supported Package Types

- cortex-theme
- cortex-module
- cortex-extension

> **Notes:**
> - Checkout Composer's [Custom Installers](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/doc/articles/custom-installers.md)
> - You can add more custom package types via the config file at `config/rinvex.composer.php`. This file provides examples of custom package types. To understand how it works, consider examining the [composer plugin](src/Models/Plugin.php) logic.

### Basic Usage

Rinvex Cortex modules, extensions and themes are installed to customizable paths, allowing placement wherever you prefer. The default configurations use these paths:

- **`cortex-theme`** - `config('rinvex.composer.cortex-theme.path')` (default: `app/themes`) 
- **`cortex-module`** - `config('rinvex.composer.cortex-module.path')` (default: `app/modules`) 
- **`cortex-extension`** - `config('rinvex.composer.cortex-extension.path')` (default: `app/extensions`)

When creating a new Rinvex Cortex module, extension, or theme, specify the correct composer package type in your package's `composer.json`. Use `"type": "cortex-module"` for modules, `"type": "cortex-extension"` for extensions, and `"type": "cortex-theme"` for themes.

Afterward, execute `composer install` or `composer update` in your application's root directory. The Rinvex Composer Installer will identify the package type and place it in the correct directory.
