# Rinvex Composer

An intuitive package that utilizes Composer Plugin API to support additional actions during installation, such as installing packages outside of the default vendor library and running custom scripts during install, update, and uninstall processes.

> **Note:** **Rinvex Composer** also handles any module specific install/uninstall logic, so if your custom **cortext-module** contains for example migrations and/or seeds, it will be automatically executed upon composer installation.


## Installation

1. Install the package via composer:
    ```shell
    composer require rinvex/composer
    ```

2. **Optionally** add the following service provider to the `'providers'` array inside `app/config/app.php`:
    ```php
    Rinvex\Composer\Providers\ComposerServiceProvider::class
    ```

   And then you can publish the config file by running the following command:
    ```shell
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rinvex\Composer\Providers\ComposerServiceProvider" --tag="config"
    ```

3. Done!


## Usage

As it should be clear, the main purpose of this package is to modify composer's behaviour so packages of custom types could be installed in directories other than the default `vendor`.

### Supported Package Types

- cortex-module
- cortex-custom

> **Note:** Checkout Composer's [Custom Installers](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/doc/articles/custom-installers.md)

### Basic Usage

All Rinvex Cortex modules are installed into the following paths accordingly:

- **`cortex-module`** - `app`
- **`cortex-custom`** - `custom/path`

So if you're building a new Rinvex Cortex module, you have to add the appropriate composer package type in your package's `composer.json`, such as `"type": "cortex-module"` for modules.

> **Note:** Checkout Rinvex [Module Package](https://github.com/rinvex/module) documentation for further details.

### Custom Paths

This is a powerful feature available for more flexibility and control over package installation paths. To use custom paths, your package's `composer.json` file must have the following attributes:
```json
"type": "cortex-custom",
"require": {
    "rinvex/composer": "^1.0.0"
},
"extra": {
    "path": "custom/path/"
}
```
Then you've to run `composer install` or `composer update` at your application root directory, and **Rinvex Composer** Installer will detect the custom package type and look for `extra.path`. If it finds it; the package will be installed to that custom directory.

### Overriding Custom Paths

It's nice to give packages the ability to set their own installation paths, but on some hosts where there's some restrictions it may be a problem; In such case you may have to take control and enforce these packages to be installed within certain directory.

You can override package-level paths at the application-level through `extra.paths` attribute in your application `composer.json` file:
```json
"require": {
    "vendor/package": "^1.0.0"
},
"extra": {
    "paths": {
        "vendor/package": "enforced/overriden/path/for/vendor/package/"
    }
}
```

Accordingly, this application-level path override will take precedence over any package-level custom paths.
